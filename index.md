**1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**
   - The most interesting topic covered in my domain this quarter is agents and agentic frameworks. Through the replication project I was able to understand how different agents can work togetehr to automate complex tasks and improve efficiency.
     
**2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**
   - A potential investigation i would like to pursue for me Quarter 2 project would be to build an agentic drug repurposing agent. I would like to focus on using this agent to identify new uses for existing drugs while targeting neurodivergent conditions such as ADHD, Tourette's syndorme, Alzheimer's etc.
     
**3. What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**
   - A potential change I would make to the approach taken in my Quarter 1 project would be to extend the current replication project to identify new relationships. Our current dataset has listed pre defined relationships between drugs and diseases. However, in order to fully utlize the benefits of agentic frameworks and knowledge graphs, i would like to adapt the pipeline explore new cross drug-disease relationships.
     
**4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**
   - A few other technques i would be interested in using in my project would be to use multiple 'specialist' agents to each analyze different candidate drugs and determine the best option based on a general concensus to recreate a sort of laboratory feel with different scientists and different specializations.
   - Another technique i would like to implement would be to include a simple chatbot.
